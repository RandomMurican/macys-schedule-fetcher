# macys-schedule-fetcher
Converts work schedule posted to Macy's Insite to an iCal in iCloud

To allow this script to change your iCloud calendar you need to generate an app-specific password at appleid.apple.com under the security section. Your own iCloud password will get denied.

Other than that you just feed runit.main() your login info and the calendar name and it does the rest.
